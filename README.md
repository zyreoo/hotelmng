# stayora


the core idea is this: i had an idea, how is to build something that i can use? something that i can make my life easier? my father has a hotel, he uses papers and pens to manage the hotel. so i said to myself why not to build this? what keeps me there? and i build it, and yes it s a startup. hope this startup make me financial independent, hope that i can start my road in life with this.
